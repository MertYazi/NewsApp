# NewsApp

It's a demo project to follow the latest news, search in old news and save the news you want to keep for later readings.<br /><br />
Project is written in Kotlin.ðŸ’¯

<br />

### The Aim Of The Project
Implementing new technologies and best practices in android development such as:
- [MVVM](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Its principal advantage is that it caches state and persists it through configuration changes.<br /><br />
- [Navigation Components](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started) - Navigation component helps you implement navigation, from simple button clicks to more complex patterns, such as app bars and the navigation drawer.<br /><br />
- [Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - It's a new collection of libraries that contains the lifecycle-aware components. It can solve problems with configuration changes, supports data persistence, reduces boilerplate code, helps to prevent memory leaks and simplifies async data loading into your UI.<br /><br />
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - In addition to opening the doors to asynchronous programming, coroutines also provide a wealth of other possibilities, such as concurrency and actors.<br /><br />
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java. Retrofit turns your HTTP API into a Java interface.<br /><br />
- [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) - The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.<br /><br />
- [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - LiveData is an observable data holder class. Unlike a regular observable, LiveData is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services.<br /><br />
- [WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager) - WorkManager is the recommended solution for persistent work. Work is persistent when it remains scheduled through app restarts and system reboots.<br /><br />
- [Notifications](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/notifications) - A notification is a message that Android displays outside your app's UI to provide the user with reminders, communication from other people, or other timely information from your app.<br /><br />
- [Sharing](https://developer.android.com/training/sharing) - Common ways you can send and receive simple data (like text, images and files) between applications using the Android Share sheet and Intent Resolver with Intent objects.<br /><br />
- [ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) - View binding is a feature that allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views. Once view binding is enabled in a module, it generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module.<br /><br />
- [Pagination](https://medium.com/@anitaa_1990/pagination-in-recyclerview-without-paging-library-1c48e9328f81) - Pagination helps you load and display small chunks of data at a time. Loading partial data on demand reduces usage of network bandwidth and system resources.<br /><br />
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - Glide is a fast and efficient open source media management and image loading framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy to use interface.
